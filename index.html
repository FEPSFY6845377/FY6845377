           <p class="ex1">
             In 1950 the world witnessed the first Formula 1 world championship season with teams such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Mercedes-Benz rolling out with elegant, smooth and relatively simple looking cars. Fast forward today in 2023, and those very same teams are now running with more complex and even faster machinery. This is due to the incredible advancements made in aerodynamics by the teams, helping suck the car down into the tarmac (Red Bull, n.d.). In turn, this allows for cornering speeds of up to +190 mph pulling nearly 7g of lateral acceleration (www.formula1.com, n.d.). This was achieved by using aerofoils, and ground effects to help create downforce and force all 4 tyre into the track to ensure maximum grip at speed. This made these machines faster but not always safer.

           <p class="ex1">
             The use of Aerodynamics in Formula 1 was first seen on Graham Hillâ€™s Lotus at the Monaco Grand Prix of 1968. This came in the form of a front and rear aerofoil. These aerofoils gave resemblance to an upside-down aeroplane wing, the engineers at Lotus cleverly understood that if a normal wing could make an aeroplane fly, an inverted wing should create a similar force but in the other direction[3]. As a result, Hill was able to corner faster and break later due to the help the aerofoils gave the car. On that Saturday, Hill took Pole position by a margin of 0.6 seconds, he went on to dominate the race the following Sunday. 
The wings worked by creating a pressure difference (low-pressure on the underside and higher-pressure top surface) by redirecting incoming airflow as far up as possible. This difference in pressure causes a force, pushing the car down into the track called downforce.[4] Think of it like moving you hand though water at a swimming pool, If you flatten you hand and move it though the water will easily slice though the water without much force. However, If you angle your hand and move it though the water you will notice a downwards force pushing your hand down into the water.  This is the type of effect that is achieved by these aerofoils.
As teams and engineer invested and researched into aerodynamics many more innovations came along such as the endplate to reduce losses at the wing-tip of the aerofoil, and multi element wings to help create more consistent and higher downforce figures. However, one such engineer would develop a design so effective that it would outlawed by the F1 rules in less than 5 years of its introduction.
